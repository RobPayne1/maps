# maps

A Flutter maps project based on this [Flutter Google Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter)

## Getting Started

Make sure to update the web/index.html file with the correct Google Maps API key before building the flutter web application. Here is the code that needs updating:
```bash
  <!--Google Maps API-->
  <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=ENTER-API-KEY-HERE"></script>
```

## Be Careful Running This!

Each run costs $$ 

Here is the Google Maps API pricing: https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=googleads&utm_campaign=brand_generic_pricing_exa_desk_mobile_us&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2uRpKzjK1NTiCYQA3WuvPRCf9df8VHS9C51S_Qv3Z2M0fcqnwj0SJRoCwAEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
